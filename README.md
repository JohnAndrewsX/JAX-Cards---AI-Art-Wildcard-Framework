# JAX Cards - AI Art Wildcard Framework

Welcome to the JAX Wildcard Project! This repository is a comprehensive collection of wildcards for use with generative AI tools like Fooocus and Stable Diffusion. Our wildcards are designed to enhance the versatility and creativity of your AI-generated content, offering a wide range of options across various categories.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories: `core` and `extended`.

### Core

The `core` directory contains the essential wildcards that form the foundation of our collection. These wildcards are general and broadly applicable, covering fundamental categories such as actions, artifacts, atmosphere, character, color, fauna, flora, genres, objects, and styles.

### Extended

The `extended` directory includes more specialized and detailed wildcards. These are designed for more specific use cases and scenarios, providing depth and nuance to your AI-generated content. Categories in the `extended` directory include academic disciplines, advanced professions, artistic movements, fictional universes, and much more.

## Key Features

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: With thousands of wildcards across numerous categories, this project offers extensive coverage to meet diverse creative needs.
- **Hierarchical Organization**: Wildcards are organized in a hierarchical structure, making it easy to navigate and find specific entries.
- **Modular Design**: Both core and extended wildcards can be used independently or combined to create rich and varied AI-generated content.
- **Open Source**: The core wildcards are open-source, providing a solid foundation for everyone. The extended wildcards offer advanced features and detailed content for specialized needs.
