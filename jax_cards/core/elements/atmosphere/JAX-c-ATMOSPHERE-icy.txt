Icy conditions creating slippery surfaces
Ice forming on the ground
Icy weather with freezing temperatures
Ice covering everything
Icy wind making it feel colder
Frozen and icy conditions
Ice creating a dangerous atmosphere
Icy weather with no snowfall
Ice making it hard to walk
Icy surfaces reflecting the light
